                <p class="content_text">Trail running is a sport/activity which consists of running and hiking over trails. 
                In the United Kingdom and Ireland it is also called mountain or fell running although 
                the two types do differ. It differs from road running and track running in that it 
                generally takes place on hiking trails, often in mountainous terrain, where there 
                can be much larger ascents and descents. It is difficult to definitively distinguish 
                trail running from cross country running. </p>

                <p class="content_text">The amount of organized trail races has grown over the past 
                few years throughout the world, now well into the hundreds in North America alone.
                Runners often cite less impact stress compared to road running, as well as the 
                landscape and non-urban environment, as primary reasons for preferring trail running.
                This move to nature is also reflected in a large increase in competitors in 
                non-traditional/off-road triathlons and adventure racing over the past five years.

        <h3>TRAIL RUNNING</h3>

                <p class="content_text">Mountain or fell running, also known as hill running, 
                is the sport of running and racing, off-road, over upland country where the 
                gradient climbed is a significant component of the difficulty. 
                The name arises from the origins of the English sport on the fells of 
                northern Britain, especially those in the Lake District. Fell races are 
                organized on the premise that contenders possess mountain navigation skills 
                and carry adequate survival equipment as prescribed by the organizer.

                <p class="content_text">Because of the natural or serene setting, 
                trail running is viewed as a more spiritual activity than roadside running 
                or jogging. Another reason for growth and popularity is the continual
                acknowledgment of environmentalism. There is a stress among many trail-race 
                organizers to keep these races "green" or environmentally friendly and minimize
                disturbance within the natural environment.
