                <p class="content_text">Trail running is a sport/activity which consists of running and hiking over trails. 
                In the United Kingdom and Ireland it is also called mountain or fell running although 
                the two types do differ. It differs from road running and track running in that it 
                generally takes place on hiking trails, often in mountainous terrain, where there 
                can be much larger ascents and descents. It is difficult to definitively distinguish 
                trail running from cross country running. </p>
