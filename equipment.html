                <p class="content_text">The beauty of trail running is that you don’t have to carry a bunch of
                gear to get out there. In its simplest form, trail running requires only a pair of quality shoes 
                and comfortable running clothes. However, most runners will carry some amount of food, water, 
                clothing and extra gear with them.
                There are a number of different methods for carrying these things and choosing which one is
                right for you is not always simple.  </p>

                <p class="content_text">If you run long distances, especially in the wilderness, then you’ll need
                to carry more food, water and gear than a race belt, handheld bottle or waistpack allows. 
                A running vest or backpack has the capacity to fit the extra essentials.
                The line between running vests and backpacks is sometimes blurry. A running backpack generally 
                has a larger capacity and looks more like a pack you’d take on a day hike while a running vest 
                usually has a lower profile and lots of smaller pockets for stowing food, water, clothing and 
                extra gear.

                <p class="content_text">Poles have long been considered essential equipment by most backpackers,
                but runners have been slower to adopt them. But I sense this is changing, based on the number 
                of pole-carrying runners I now see at the starting lines of ultra- and mountain-trail marathons.
                Essentially, the more hiking you expect to do, the more valuable they’ll be. At most running 
                speeds they have minimal or no benefit, and mostly just get in the way and alter proper running form.

                <p class="content_text">Today’s GPS watches have all the sport-specific features to track every 
                stride on the roads, but they’re also packed with other sensors and technology to keep you 
                connected the rest of the day, too. But they’re also a pretty sizable investment that you’ll 
                want to last for years and miles to come. In most cases, more features mean a bigger dollar 
                sign when you’re shopping for a new GPS watch. While there are ways to cut down on price—like
                buying a refurbished version or opting for an older model of a recently released watch—narrowing 
                down the features you need is key. And that doesn’t just include fitness features.
