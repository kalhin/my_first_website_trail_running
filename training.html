                <p class="content_text">Trail Running is a kind of sport that involves you whole body and, therefore,
                requires a good starting physiological shape, a muscle-articular structure well trained to withstand 
                the stresses resulting from training and competing.
                Indeed, unlike in road competitions, speed is just as important as the ability to overcome differences 
                in height and trail track situations that may become even more complex with mud, rain, or snow.
                Before starting a trail running training program is, therefore, advisable to plan a sport medical 
                check-up, essential to assess the overall fitness shape including complete blood tests.

                <p class="content_text">From the 2nd Month, if you have done the workout properly and your body 
                responded well to the adjustment period, you can start a new phase of the program that 
                includes variations of pace, and short climbs. These workouts will replace the workout 
                on Thursday.

                <p class="content_text">Fartlek, run with pace variations on flat surface = 1 min Fast alternating 
                to 1 min Slow to be repeated 8/10 times.
                <br>
                Progressive training on undulated surface = increase your running pace every 10-20-10-5 minutes 
                up to a total of 45 minutes
                <br>
                Short uphill = run 8×100 meters uphill increasing the pace, inclination 6%-8%, recovery by 
                slow run downhill to starting point
                <br>
                For the 1st and 3rd week we suggest you choose the Fartlek session; in the 2nd and 4th week 
                choose between the Progressive training and the Short uphill

                <p class="content_text">At the beginning of the 3rd Month you will be able to start a preparation for
                a specific goal.
                Athletes practising other sports and already well trained from a cardiovascular point of view, 
                from the 3rd week of the 1st Month of Trail Running can add on Thursday one of the above workouts, 
                and increase 30 minutes the Saturday / Sunday long run. Furthermore, we suggest them to add an 
                additional training session on Friday starting from the 2nd month: a run at of 30 minutes at a
                slow pace followed by 7-8 sprint runs of 15 sec recovering by walking 45 sec in between.
